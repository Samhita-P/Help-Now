        <h3>Weather-Related First Aid</h3>
        <p>Weather conditions can cause a variety of health issues, ranging from heat-related illnesses to cold-induced injuries. Below are 20 common weather-related first aid situations and how to address them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heat Exhaustion (Hot Weather):</strong>
                <p>Symptoms include heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and headaches. Move the person to a cooler place, provide fluids, and apply cool compresses. Encourage rest. If symptoms worsen, seek medical attention.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Heat Stroke (Hot Weather):</strong>
                <p>Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition. Symptoms include confusion, seizures, and unconsciousness. Call for emergency help immediately, move the person to a cooler area, and apply ice packs to the body.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Sunburn (Hot Weather):</strong>
                <p>Apply cool water to the affected area, use aloe vera gel or sunburn relief lotion. Stay hydrated and avoid direct sunlight. If blisters develop, seek medical care to prevent infection.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Dehydration (Hot and Dry Climates):</strong>
                <p>Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, fatigue, and dark urine. Encourage the individual to drink water or electrolyte drinks. For severe dehydration, seek medical help, as IV fluids may be necessary.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Heat Rash (Hot Weather):</strong>
                <p>Heat rash occurs due to sweat trapped in sweat ducts. Move the person to a cooler environment, remove any tight clothing, and apply cool compresses. Avoid scratching the rash to prevent infection.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Hypothermia (Cold Weather):</strong>
                <p>Hypothermia occurs when the body temperature drops below 95°F (35°C). Symptoms include shivering, confusion, and drowsiness. Move the person to a warm environment, remove wet clothing, and gradually warm them up. Avoid using direct heat and seek medical attention.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Frostbite (Cold Weather):</strong>
                <p>Frostbite affects extremities like fingers, toes, and ears. Gently warm the affected areas with lukewarm water. Avoid direct heat, and never rub the affected skin. Seek medical help for severe cases.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Windburn (Cold and Windy Weather):</strong>
                <p>Windburn occurs when cold, dry winds cause skin irritation. Apply a gentle moisturizer to the affected skin and avoid exposure to harsh winds. Use a scarf or face mask to protect skin in the future.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Snow Blindness (Snowy Weather):</strong>
                <p>Snow blindness is caused by UV radiation reflecting off snow. If you experience symptoms like pain, blurred vision, or redness, move to a shaded area and use sunglasses or goggles. Apply cold compresses and seek medical attention if symptoms persist.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Shivering (Cold Weather):</strong>
                <p>Shivering is the body's natural response to cold temperatures. Help the person warm up gradually by covering them with blankets and providing warm drinks. If shivering persists and they show signs of hypothermia, seek medical help.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Cold Water Shock (Cold Water Exposure):</strong>
                <p>When exposed to cold water, the body can experience a rapid shock. If someone falls into cold water, call for help immediately, and keep them as still as possible. Help them get out of the water and warm them up slowly. Seek medical attention if needed.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Thunderstorm Injury (Stormy Weather):</strong>
                <p>During thunderstorms, avoid using electrical appliances and seek shelter. If someone is struck by lightning, perform CPR and seek emergency help immediately. Lightning strikes can cause burns, cardiac arrest, or neurological damage.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Flood Injury (Flooding or Heavy Rain):</strong>
                <p>If caught in a flood, move to higher ground and avoid contact with floodwaters, which may be contaminated. If injured, clean the wound with clean water and apply a sterile bandage. Seek medical help if needed.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Hail Injury (Hailstorms):</strong>
                <p>During hailstorms, seek shelter immediately. If injured by hail, apply ice to bruises and cuts to reduce swelling. For head injuries, apply pressure to stop bleeding and seek medical attention.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Lightning Strike (Stormy Weather):</strong>
                <p>If someone is struck by lightning, call emergency services immediately. Perform CPR if necessary and treat burns with cool, running water. Do not touch the victim if they are still in contact with a live power source.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Wind Chill (Cold Weather with High Winds):</strong>
                <p>Wind chill can cause frostbite and hypothermia more quickly. Shelter from the wind, cover exposed skin, and wear multiple layers of clothing. Seek shelter indoors as soon as possible if the wind chill becomes dangerous.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Dust Storm Injury (Dry and Windy Climates):</strong>
                <p>If exposed to a dust storm, cover your mouth with a cloth, wear protective goggles, and avoid inhaling the dust. Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. If symptoms like coughing or shortness of breath persist, seek medical help.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Rainwater Contamination (Rainy Season):</strong>
                <p>Rainwater can sometimes carry pathogens. Avoid drinking unfiltered rainwater, especially in areas with poor sanitation. If exposed to contaminated water, watch for symptoms of gastrointestinal distress and seek medical attention if necessary.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Slippery Roads and Falls (Rain, Snow, or Ice):</strong>
                <p>After rain or snow, the ground may become slippery, increasing the risk of falls. In case of injury, immobilize the affected area and seek medical help. For cuts or abrasions, clean and bandage the wound.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Altitude Sickness (High-Altitude Areas):</strong>
                <p>Altitude sickness can occur in areas above 8,000 feet. Symptoms include headache, nausea, and dizziness. Gradually ascend to avoid altitude sickness and drink plenty of water. If symptoms persist, descend to lower altitudes and seek medical help.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Each weather condition poses its unique set of challenges, and understanding how to respond to these conditions can save lives. Always remember that first aid is a temporary solution, and in severe cases, professional medical help should be sought immediately.</em></p>
